# Real Estate Market Analysis in New York

## Introduction

This comprehensive project leverages advanced predictive analytics to forecast real estate price trends across New York's diverse zip codes. It aims to provide strategic insights for informed investment decisions in the dynamic New York real estate market.

## Business Problem

We are engaged by a leading real estate investment firm, known for its strategic and data-driven approach to the New York property market. The firm seeks to continue its legacy of high-return investments by identifying promising real estate opportunities. The key question is: Can we predict the future trends of property prices in New York's diverse zip codes using historical data?

## Data Overview

We utilize an extensive dataset from Zillow, covering April 1996 to April 2018. This dataset includes critical variables such as RegionID, RegionName (zip codes), and median property values, providing a comprehensive view of the New York real estate landscape.

## Project Approach

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**: Standardizing data formats and handling missing data for accurate analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating underlying trends and characteristics of the New York real estate market.
3. **Stationarity Testing & Data Transformation**: Applying statistical tests and transformations to prepare data for time series modeling.
4. **Model Development & Forecasting**: Building ARIMA models for each zip code to forecast future real estate prices and evaluating model performance.
5. **Risk Analysis and Cross-Validation**: Implementing strategies to enhance model reliability and integrate risk metrics.

## Technical Aspects

- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels.
- Techniques: Time Series Analysis, ARIMA Modeling, Data Visualization.

## Key Findings

1. **Variable Market Dynamics**: Different zip codes exhibit varying growth rates and risk profiles.
2. **Forecasting Accuracy**: Models show differing levels of predictive accuracy, with some zip codes presenting more reliable forecasts than others.
3. **Investment Insights**: The analysis identifies potential investment hotspots based on growth and risk projections.

## Results & Visualizations
- **ARIMA Model Results**: Detailed results from the ARIMA models, showcasing the predictive accuracy for each zip code.
- **Visualizing the Financial Crisis**: A graphical representation of how the real estate market responded to the economic downturn, highlighting key trends and recoveries.
  
## Recommendations
Based on ARIMA model forecasts, the project suggests top zip codes for investment, balancing potential growth against associated risks.
